    person("Stephen", "Coleman", , "colemste@ohsu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A streamlined implementation of differential methylated region (DMR) 
    analysis from the amethyst package. Provides focused functionality for DMR 
    detection from single-cell methylation data with minimal dependencies.
    Implements efficient algorithms for indexing H5 files, calculating smoothed
    methylation windows, and statistical testing for differential methylation.
